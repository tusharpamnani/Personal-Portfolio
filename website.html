                    <p>A few things only keep you in deep pain and grief. People go through much pain to avoid pain. And "what ifs" are the most painful words of them. Well, what could a mere word cause harm to? Actually, this word could eventually drift you from reality to fantasy. It is the desire to change what it is or what it could be- that grieves a person, the most. The expectations left unfilled take over you and force you to ponder the possible outcomes that could have happened in your life. Definitely, some are pretty much easier and desirable ones but a few are even pitiful and sympathetic. But these "what ifs" never meet reality and often leave the past in you. These "what ifs" bind you with your past where you might have had a choice and now will to have taken the other the way. These only leave you with the fact of how helpless you are to not change the past but rather live in the present, unhappy. They only make you realise how there is a steep difference between what you had expected and what happened. They only leave you with sorrow and pain. The more you think about these "what ifs", the more you end up hurting yourself.</p>

                    <p>
                        Not only do we grieve about our past but also we constantly think about our future. We try out thinking about every possible outcome- every possible "what if", not realising that we are simply ruining our present by just thinking and not even enacting it out. These "what ifs" often force you to think the worst of the situation, hurting yourself and leaving you with deep pain. In the end, you can never change the situation, the only thing you can do is change the way to deal with it. Remember, your present situation is not your final destination. And these "what ifs" won't ever be any aid. The simplest way is to stop thinking about these "what ifs" by making yourself understand that whatever you are doing is better and you can always overcome the things and situations that come by. Actually, the pain never really goes away, you just elevate and get used to it by growing stronger, and by stopping thinking about the possible outcomes you aid yourself. And soon you will realise that there is nothing that means everything either to your past or to your future- it is always you!
